Hello there. I'm a researcher at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/). Here, I'm part of the research program [Adolescent Well-Being in the Digital Age](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/programme-on-adolescent-well-being-in-the-digital-age/), where I study (surprise!) the effects of technology use on well-being and performance. 

Technology and its effects have long been a focus of my work. During my PhD, I focused on the effects of always being connected via our phones on attention and cognitive control. These days, I've shifted that focus to video games and how play impacts people's mental health. I rely on large-scale (behavioral) data analysis, experiments, experience sampling, and surveys.
