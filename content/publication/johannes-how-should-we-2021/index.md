abstract: 'The study of the relation between social media use and well-being is at
  a critical junction. Many researchers find small to no associations, yet policymakers
  and public stakeholders keep asking for more evidence. One way the field is reacting
  is by inspecting the variation around average relations â€“ with the goal of describing
  individual social media users. Here, we argue that such an approach risks losing
  sight of the most important outcomes of a quantitative social science: estimates
  of the average relation in a large group. Our analysis begins by describing how
  the field got to this point. Then, we explain the problems of the current approach
  of studying variation. Next, we propose a principled approach to quantify, interpret,
  and explain variation in average relations: (1) conducting model comparisons, (2)
  defining a region of practical equivalence and testing the theoretical distribution
  of relations against that region, (3) defining a smallest effect size of interest
  and comparing it against the theoretical distribution. We close with recommendations
  to either study moderators as systematic factors that explain variation or to conduct
  N = 1 studies and qualitative research.'
