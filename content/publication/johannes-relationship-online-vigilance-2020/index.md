abstract: Through communication technology, users find themselves constantly connected
  to others to such an extent that they routinely develop a mind-set of connectedness.
  This mind-set has been defined as online vigilance. Although there is a large body
  of research on media use and well-being, the question of how online vigilance impacts
  well-being remains unanswered. In this preregistered study, we combine experience
  sampling and smartphone logging to address the relation of online vigilance and
  affective well-being in everyday life. Seventy-five Android users answered eight
  daily surveys over five days (N = 1,615) whilst having their smartphone use logged.
  Thinking about smartphone-mediated social interactions (i.e., the salience dimension
  of online vigilance) was negatively related to affective well-being. However, it
  was far more important whether those thoughts were positive or negative. No other
  dimension of online vigilance was robustly related to affective well-being. Taken
  together, our results suggest that online vigilance does not pose a serious threat
  to affective well-being in everyday life.
