abstract: There is a lively debate whether playing games that feature armed combat
  and competition (often referred to as violent video games) has measurable effects
  on aggression. Unfortunately, that debate has produced insights that remain preliminary
  without accurate behavioral data. Here, we present a secondary analysis of the most
  authoritative longitudinal data set available on the issue from our previous study
  (Vuorre et al., 2021). We analyzed objective in-game behavior, provided by video
  game companies, in 2,580 players over six weeks. Specifically, we asked how time
  spent playing two popular online shooters, Apex Legends (PEGI 16) and Outriders
  (PEGI 18), affected self-reported feelings of anger (i.e., aggressive affect). We
  found that playing these games did not increase aggressive affect; the cross-lagged
  association between game time and aggressive affect was virtually zero. Our results
  showcase the value of obtaining accurate industry data as well as an open science
  of video games and mental health that allows cumulative knowledge building.
