abstract: There is a lively debate on the effects of social media use, shaped by self-reported
  measurements of social media use. However, self-reports have been shown to suffer
  from low accuracy compared to logged measures of social media use. Even though it
  is unclear how problematic that measurement error is for our inferences, many scholars
  call for the exclusive use of “objective&” measures. But if measurement error is
  not systematic, self-reports will still be informative. In contrast, if there is
  systematic error, associations between social media use and other variables, including
  well-being, are likely biased. Here, we report an exploratory 5 day experience sampling
  study among 96 participants (435 observations) to understand factors that could
  relate to low accuracy. First, we asked what stable individual differences are related
  to low accuracy. Second, we explored what daily states relate to accuracy. Third,
  we explored whether accuracy relates to well-being. Although we did find evidence
  for a systematic tendency to overestimate social media use, neither individual differences
  nor daily states were related to that tendency. Accuracy was also unrelated to well-being.
  Our results suggest that blindly calling for objective measures foregoes a responsibility
  to understand measurement error in social media use first.
