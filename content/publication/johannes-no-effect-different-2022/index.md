abstract: 'It is often assumed that traditional forms of media such as books enhance
  well-being, whereas new media do not. However, we lack evidence for such claims
  and media research is mainly focused on how much time people spend with a medium,
  but not whether someone used a medium or not. We explored the effect of media use
  during one week on well-being at the end of the week, differentiating time spent
  with a medium and use versus nonuse, over a wide range of different media types:
  music, TV, films, video games, (e-)books, (digital) magazines, and audiobooks. Results
  from a six-week longitudinal study representative of the UK population 16 years
  and older (N=2159) showed that effects were generally small; between-person relations
  but rarely within-person effects; mostly for use versus nonuse and not time spent
  with a medium; and on affective well-being, not life satisfaction.'
