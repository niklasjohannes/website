abstract: These days, young people report to be in a state of permanent alertness
  due to their smartphones. This state has been defined as smartphone vigilance, an
  awareness that one can always get connected to others in combination with a permanent
  readiness to respond to incoming smartphone notifications. We argue that receiving
  a notification makes users vigilant and activates goals (e.g., checking the message)
  that interfere with other goals needed to perform a task. We thus hypothesized that
  smartphone vigilance impairs maintenance of current task-goals in working memory,
  resulting in increased goal-neglect. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a preregistered
  experiment that examined the effect of smartphone vigilance (incoming notifications)
  on goal-neglect in a modified Stroop task. We found evidence that participants perceived
  notifications as distracting, but vigilance did not lead to increased goal-neglect.
  To the contrary, there was tentative evidence that vigilant participants performed
  better at the task.
