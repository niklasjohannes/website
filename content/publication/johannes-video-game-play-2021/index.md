abstract: "People have never played more video games, and many stakeholders are worried\
  \ that this activity might be bad for players. So far, research has not had adequate\
  \ data to test whether these worries are justified and if policymakers should act\
  \ to regulate video game play time. We attempt to provide much-needed evidence with\
  \ adequate data. Whereas previous research had to rely on self-reported play behaviour,\
  \ we collaborated with two games companies, Electronic Arts and Nintendo of America,\
  \ to obtain players' actual play behaviour. We surveyed players of Plantsvs.Zombies:\
  \ Battle for Neighborville and Animal Crossing: New Horizons for their well-being,\
  \ motivations and need satisfaction during play, and merged their responses with\
  \ telemetry data (i.e. logged game play). Contrary to many fears that excessive\
  \ play time will lead to addiction and poor mental health, we found a small positive\
  \ relation between game play and affective well-being. Need satisfaction and motivations\
  \ during play did not interact with play time but were instead independently related\
  \ to well-being. Our results advance the field in two important ways. First, we\
  \ show that collaborations with industry partners can be done to high academic standards\
  \ in an ethical and transparent fashion. Second, we deliver much-needed evidence\
  \ to policymakers on the link between play and mental health."
