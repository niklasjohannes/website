abstract: 'As mobile technology allows users to be online anywhere and at all times,
  a growing number of users report feeling constantly alert and preoccupied with online
  streams of online information and communication—a phenomenon that has recently been
  termed online vigilance. Despite its growing prevalence, consequences of this constant
  orientation toward online streams of information and communication for users’ well-being
  are largely unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether being constantly
  vigilant is related to cognitive consequences in the form of increased mind-wandering
  and decreased mindfulness and examined the resulting implications for well-being.
  To test our assumptions, we estimated a path model based on survey data (N = 371).
  The model supported the majority of our preregistered hypotheses: online vigilance
  was indeed related to mindwandering and mindfulness, but only mindfulness mediated
  the relationship with decreased well-being. Thus, those mentally preoccupied with
  online communication were overall less satisﬁed with their lives and reported less
  affective well-being when they also experienced reduced mindfulness.'
