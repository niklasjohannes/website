abstract: 'Human behavior can be classified into 2 basic categories: execution of
  responses and withholding responses. This classification is used in go/no-go training,
  where people respond to some objects and withhold their responses to other objects.
  Despite its simplicity, there is now substantial evidence that such training is
  powerful in changing human behavior toward such objects. However, it is poorly understood
  how simple responses can influence behavior. Contrary to the remarkably tenacious
  idea that go/no-go training changes behavior by strengthening inhibitory control,
  we propose that the training changes behavior via changes in explicit liking of
  objects. In two preregistered experiments, we show that go/no-go training influences
  explicit liking for smartphone apps (Experiments 1 and 2) and that this liking partially
  mediates the effect of the training on consequential choices for using these apps
  1 day later (Experiment 2). The results highlight the role of evaluations when examining
  how motor response training influences behavior. This knowledge can inform development
  of more effective applied motor response training procedures and raises new theoretical
  questions on the relation between motor responses and affect.'
