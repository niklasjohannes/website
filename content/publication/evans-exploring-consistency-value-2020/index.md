abstract: Establishing generalisable humour style profiles promises to have significant
  value for educational, clinical, and occupational application. However, previous
  research investigating such profiles has thus far presented inconsistent results.
  To determine the generalisability and value of humour style profiles, a large and
  geographically diverse examination of humour styles was conducted through a cross-sectional
  questionnaire methodology involving 863 participants from across three world regions.
  Findings identify inconsistencies in the humour style profiles across countries
  tested and the extant literature, possibly indicative of cultural differences in
  the behavioural expression of trait humour. Furthermore, when directly compared,
  humour types, rather than humour styles, consistently provide the greatest predictive
  value for friendship and well-being outcomes. As such, with respect to both consistency
  and value, capturing humour style profiles appears to represent a relatively reductionist
  approach to appreciating the nuances in the use and consequences of humour.
