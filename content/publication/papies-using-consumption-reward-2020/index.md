abstract: The production of meat is a main contributor to current dangerous levels
  of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the shift to more plant-based diets is hampered
  by consumers finding meat-based foods more attractive than plant-based foods. How
  can plant-based foods best be described to increase their appeal to consumers? Based
  on the grounded cognition theory of desire, we suggest that descriptions that trigger
  simulations, or re-experiences, of eating and enjoying a food will increase the
  attractiveness of a food, compared to descriptions emphasizing ingredients. In Study
  1, we first examined the descriptions of ready meals available in four large UK
  supermarkets (N = 240). We found that the labels of meat-based foods contained more
  references to eating simulations than vegetarian foods, and slightly more than plant-based
  foods, and that this varied between supermarkets. In Studies 2 and 3 (N = 170, N = 166,
  pre-registered), we manipulated the labels of plant-based and meat-based foods to
  either include eating simulation words or not. We assessed the degree to which participants
  reported that the description made them think about eating the food (i.e., induced
  eating simulations), and how attractive they found the food. In Study 2, where either
  sensory or eating context words were added, we found no differences with control
  labels. In Study 3, however, where simulation-based labels included sensory, context,
  and hedonic words, we found that simulation-based descriptions increased eating
  simulations and attractiveness. Moreover, frequent meat eaters found plant-based
  foods less attractive, but this was attenuated when plant-based foods were described
  with simulation-inducing words. We suggest that language that describes rewarding
  eating experiences can be used to facilitate the shift toward healthy and sustainable
  diets.
