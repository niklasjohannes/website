abstract: Video games are a massively popular form of entertainment, socialising,
  cooperation, and competition. Games’ ubiquity fuels fears that they cause poor mental
  health, and major health bodies and national governments have made far-reaching
  policy decisions to address games’ potential risks, despite lacking adequate supporting
  data. The concern-evidence mismatch underscores that we know too little about games’
  impacts on well-being. We addressed this disconnect by linking six weeks of 38,030
  players’ objective game-behaviour data, provided by six global game publishers,
  with three waves of their self-reported well-being that we collected. We found little
  to no evidence for a causal connection between gameplay and well-being. However,
  results suggested that motivations play a role in players’ well- being. For good
  or ill, the average effects of time spent playing video games on players’ well-being
  are likely very small, and further industry data are required to determine potential
  risks and supportive factors to health.
